RAG-based Text Document Search with Embeddings
RAG-based Text Document Search with Embeddings
This project demonstrates how to load a text document, split it into chunks, generate embeddings for each chunk, store both the text chunks and their embeddings, and conduct vector search to return similar documents to a query. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, where the Gemini model generates responses based on context from similar documents.

Project Overview
This project covers:

Document Ingestion: Loading a text document and splitting it into manageable chunks.
Embeddings Generation: Generating embeddings for each document chunk.
Vector Store: Storing document chunks and their embeddings for efficient retrieval.
Vector Search: Using vector search to retrieve relevant document chunks based on a query.
RAG Response Generation: Using the Gemini model to generate responses based on similar document contexts.
